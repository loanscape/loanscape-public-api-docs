Welcome - the Loanscape API allows lenders to fetch data for their applications and TPOs on Loanscape. You can use this to wire up Loanscape with Hubspot, your own server, or other tools and CRMs.

You can use endpoints to fetch data from our read-only API, and set up webhooks to receive notifications when applications are created or updated.

You can try out our API right here in the browser with demo data or your real API key. In the [Authentication section](/pages/authentication) we'll tell you how to generate an API key or how to use the test key.

<Tip>
  **Note:** the Loanscape API is a work in progress and may be subject to change.
