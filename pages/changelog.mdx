###  June 2025 

We're adding detailed licensing information to `tpo.branches`, now synced with NMLS.

We're adding some fields to the `tpo` object within applications:
- `tpo.stateLicenses` (now synced with NMLS)
- `tpo.businessStructure`
- `tpo.stockSymbol`
- `tpo.ncua`
- `tpo.fdic`

We're removing `ncua` and `fdic` from `tpo.industryApprovals` as they can now be found above. We're adding `ginnieMae` to `tpo.industryApprovals`.

We're removing `tpo.contractProcessors`.

Users within `tpo.team` now have an `isAuthorizedSigner` field.

We're renaming a couple fields:
- `tpo.operatingStates` -> `tpo.licensedStates` (now synced with NMLS)
- `tpo.dbas` -> `tpo.tradeNames` (now synced with NMLS)

<Tip>
  **Tip**: we don't recommend using the `Fetch all applications` endpoint with many complex fields. This can cause errors as a result of trying to fetch too much data at once. You can fetch complex, detailed data using the `Fetch an application` endpoint for a single application.
