###  July 2025 

We're adding a `licensing` object within applications which contains detailed licensing information, synced with NMLS. This is a premium feature - contact the Loanscape team to confirm that you have access.

The licensing object contains the following fields:

- `licensing.tradeNames`
- `licensing.licensedStates`
- `licensing.stateLicenses`
- `licensing.processors`
- `licensing.loanOfficers`
- `licensing.branches`

Some of these fields previously existed on the `tpo` object and took a different format, manually inputted by the TPO. These fields are being removed:

- `tpo.tradeNames`
- `tpo.operatingStates`
- `tpo.dbas`
- `tpo.contractProcessors`

We're adding the following fields to the `tpo` object within applications:

- `tpo.businessStructure`
- `tpo.stockSymbol`
- `tpo.ncua`
- `tpo.fdic`

We're removing `tpo.industryApprovals.ncua` and `tpo.industryApprovals.fdic` as they can now be found above. We're adding `tpo.industryApprovals.ginnieMae`.

Users within `tpo.team` now have an `isAuthorizedSigner` field.

<Tip>
  **Tip**: `licensing.loanOfficers` and `licensing.branches` cannot be requested using the `Fetch all applications` endpoint. In general, we don't recommend using the `Fetch all applications` endpoint with many complex fields. This can cause errors as a result of trying to fetch too much data at once. You can fetch complex, detailed data using the `Fetch an application` endpoint for a single application.
