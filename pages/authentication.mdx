title: 'Authentication'
---

All API endpoints are authenticated using your API token. You can generate an API token in the [API/Webhooks section of your settings screen](https://app.loanscape.io/dashboard/settings/developers) on Loanscape.

Pass your token in the X-API-TOKEN header to all requests to the Loanscape API. For example:

`X-API-TOKEN: 01DiH...11A9X`

Keep your token safe. You should generate a new token if you believe your token may have been compromised - this will expire your existing token.

Keep in mind that the "Try it" sections within the API documentation connect to the production API at app.loanscape.io. If you created your API token on another deployment (such as demo.loanscape.io), your API token won't work in the "Try it" sections.
