title: 'Authentication'
---

All API endpoints are authenticated using your API token. You can generate an API token in your [API/Webhooks settings](https://app.loanscape.io/dashboard/settings/developers) on Loanscape.

Pass your token in the X-API-TOKEN header to all requests to the Loanscape API. For example:

`X-API-TOKEN: 01DiH...11A9X`

Keep your token safe. You should generate a new token if you believe your token may have been compromised - this will expire your existing token.

Keep in mind that the "Try it" sections within the API documentation connect to the production API at app.loanscape.io. If you created your API token on another deployment (such as demo.loanscape.io), your API token won't work in the "Try it" sections.

You can try passing `test/key` as your API key to receive demo data. In the **Fetch all applications** endpoint, this will return an array containing one demo application. In the **Fetch an application** endpoint, pass `applicationId` of `test_65b0dc2d39f534a1253` (using `test/key`) to return the demo application.
